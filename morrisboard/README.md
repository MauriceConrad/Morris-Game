## Logic

When I created the board logic, it had been easy, just to describe all regular 24 field of mill and setting their neighbors statically.

But that was not my goal. I wanted to generate the board dynamically and modular, so that the general logic how the mill board works in theory is implemented but you can expand the board simply by levels and connections between the fields.

**What do I mean?**
